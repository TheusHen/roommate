# ⚠️ Flutter App Discontinued

## 🛑 This Flutter Application Has Been Terminated

The Flutter version of the Roommate chat application has been **discontinued** and is **no longer maintained**. This directory contains legacy code that should **NOT** be used or run.

## 🚀 New Web Application Available

The Roommate application has been **completely migrated** to a modern Next.js web application with enhanced features and better performance.

### ✅ Use the Web Version Instead

**To run the Roommate application:**

```bash
# Navigate to the web directory
cd ../web/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Open your browser to:
# http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 Why the Migration?

The new web application provides:

- **✨ Modern Tech Stack** - Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **📱 Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **🚀 Better Performance** - Optimized for web browsers
